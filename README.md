# Codeforces Bot for Discord

![Project status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow)

This project is a Discord bot designed to interact with the Codeforces API, providing users with information about
contests, user standings, and more directly through Discord commands.

## Features

- **User Information**: Retrieve and display information about a Codeforces user.
- **Contest Information**: Get details about upcoming and finished contests.
- **User Contest Standings**: Check the standing of a user in a specific contest.
- **Compare Problem Ratings**: Get rating statistics of solved problems for a user or compare between two users.
- **Contest Tournament**: Suggest a random contest of a specified type for users. The contest will be one that none of the given usernames have participated in before. When the contest is over, the bot will announce the winners.
- **Health Check**: A simple HTTP server for health checks.

6. **Contest Tournament**:

After the virtual contest ends, the bot will send the participants' ranks along with details like:

- Number of solved problems
- Number of wrong answers during the contest

The bot can handle multiple time zones. The user can also confirm or cancel the command using buttons.
